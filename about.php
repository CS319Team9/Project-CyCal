<h1>About</h1> 
<P>CyCal is a fully customizable event calender for Iowa State University students.  
We are a group of Software and Computer Engineering students here at Iowa State, and 
CyCal was a project we decided to attempt for out ComS 319 interfaces class.  
The purpose of the project is to allow students to view and manipulate the many
